the day was new and full of sun i got up from my bed pulled the rug back and placed my foot on the mat the cup i left near the pad was still warm my pen sat by the box right next to a tiny toy and an old cap it was time to pack my bag

i took a map and a tag id used on my last trip i checked the zip on my bin and dropped in a tin of wax i saw a bug crawl near the net by the tub my cat sat on the ledge tail twitching next to a big pot and a dusty jar she looked at me like she knew my plan

my dog wagged his tail at a man and ran past a hen that flew up as a fly buzzed near a bee by the rag i grabbed my hat and my kit the rod by the door fell so i used it to push the mop back into place a fan hummed above the pit where i kept old tools a saw an axe a cog a peg the rim of the can was bent but it still held gas i tapped the lid twice to be sure

outside the fog was low a van passed by a cab both stuck behind a big red bus i climbed into my car and placed a bun and a fig in the side pod i tapped my toe and turned the key the hum of the jet above made me glance up

on the road i saw a fox dash across the tar chasing a rat near a bin a guy waved at me from his hub he wore a wig and had an old arm band with a gem on it the dam down the way still leaked near the ash pit

at the lab i saw a dot on the screen a bug in the code i tapped my pen and took notes on a pad my boss prof ng came by with a jug of tea she wore a vest with a bow and a tiny pin she gave me a nod and a bun big day he said i gave a weak smile

we met in the main room with a cog chart on the wall the orb above the lab table gave off a soft glow i passed a nut to a pal and dropped oil in a pan he used a pip and a peg to hold it in place

later i saw a box of dye spill on a rag the mess hit the log book and stained a bag i cleaned it with a mop and a bit of soap the tap ran hot we laughed as a cat jumped onto the top shelf knocking a pan and a toy down into a bin

back home i set the jar down then pulled off my cap the tub filled up as the fan spun i placed a lid over the pot to keep it warm my cat again leapt into my lap she purred as i rubbed her leg she loves man

my dog slept by the door as the hen clucked in the yard a fly buzzed past the open window while a bee sat on a flower near the mat in the den i placed a bun on a tray and sipped from a cup i flipped through a mag and saw a wig ad i remembered my pal from the van i picked up my pen and wrote a few lines the ink ran low so i grabbed a new one from the bag

the bed looked so good i dropped onto it pulling the rug over my toe and letting the fog roll in through the open tap a fig sat on the stand next to a peg and a pad the box was full of gear tools toys and even a saw id used once to fix a rod

i felt at peace the map on the wall the bar i built with logs the nut jar in the orb light they all made it feel like home i set the fan to low checked the net once more and turned off the light just before sleep i thought of that cat and her leap 

prof ng is a math professor at northwestern she loves to teach math in class with pen and paper she has a kid and man
